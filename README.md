**Description:** Overview of fundamental issues of information retrieval with theoretical foundations. The information-retrieval techniques and theory, covering both effectiveness and run-time performance of information-retrieval systems are covered. The focus is on algorithms and heuristics used to find documents relevant to the user request and to find them fast. The course covers the architecture and components of the search engine such as parser, stemmer, index builder, and query processor. The students learn the material by building a prototype of such a search engine. Prerequisites: CS 331 or CS 401; requires strong programming knowledge. 3-0-3 (C) (T)

**Textbook:** [*Introduction to Information Retrieval*](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/), Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan and Hinrich Sch√ºtze, Cambridge University Press. 2008.

- **All violations will be reported to `academichonesty@iit.edu` and may result in a failing grade for the assignment and/or course.**


**Late Submission Policy**

- Late assignments will **not** be accepted, unless:
  - There is an unavoidable medical, family, or other emergency, **and**
  - You notify me **prior** to the due date

### Course Outcomes

1. Explain the information retrieval storage methods (Inverted Index and Signature Files)
2. Explain retrieval models, such as Boolean model, Vector Space model, Probabilistic model, Inference Networks, and Neural Networks.
